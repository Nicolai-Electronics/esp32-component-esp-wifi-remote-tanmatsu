# ESP WiFi remote (Tanmatsu fork)

This repository contains a fork of ESP WiFi remote which is used in combination with the [Tanmatsu ESP-HOSTED fork](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/esp32-component-esp-hosted-tanmatsu) as a temporary solution until the required changes to ESP-HOSTED have been made on the upstream version of ESP-HOSTED.
